# Loops : When you want to run something for some number of times continuously, then we use LOOPS 

# There are 2 variaties of loops : 
#     1) For Loop        ( When you known how many times to be executed, we use for loop )
#     2) While Loop      ( when you don't know how many time to be executed, we use this and while only runs if the condition is trye )

# echo value is 10
# echo value is 20
# echo value is 30
# echo value is 40
# echo value is 50

# for x in a b c d e ; do 
#     echo print $x
# done 

for x in 10 20 30 40 50 ; do  
    echo -e "Vales are $x \n\t"
done
